## Description
I am here in this class to pursue a new career path. I built this project to test my knowledge and receive critique on how and where I can improve. This project is the third assigment I have worked on. I used some basic javascript to create a Password Generator. I am happy to find that I am still enjoying coding even when it gets frustrating. I learned to always double check my work in the browser because the inspect option can save me a few hours of heartarche.



## Installation
No need to install click the link and the Password Generator will run.

## Usage
This is a password generator. This program is here to generate a strong password with upper and lowercase characters as well as special text and numbers.
