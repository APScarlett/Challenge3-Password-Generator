 ## Description
  I built this project to test my knowledge and receive critique on how and where I can improve. This project is the third assigment I have worked on. I used some basic javascript to create a Password Generator. I am happy to find that I am still enjoying coding even when it gets frustrating. I learned to always double check my work in the browser because the inspect option can save me a few hours of heartarche.
